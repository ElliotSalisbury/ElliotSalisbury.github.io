## Introduction

Allometry is the study of how organisms change in relation to proportional changes in their body size.
In order to measure the health and growth of a forest, we used drones to fly measure the height and canopy area of each individual tree.
From these measures, an estimate of the body mass can be estimated.

That body mass was then used in a carbon sequestration measure, so that landowners could sell provable carbon credits.
