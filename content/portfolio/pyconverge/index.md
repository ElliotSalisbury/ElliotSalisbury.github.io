I try to keep up to date with the latest research and libraries available in python.
However, I feel the search quality on YouTube is getting worse, and finding relevant PyCon videos was getting harder.
I decided to build a tool that collects the videos from PyCon and Data Science related channels on YouTube, and make those videos sortable and searchable.
Now it is easy to follow trending videos, new uploads, and find content relating to your topic of interest.
