I occasionally give talks to my local machine learning community.
In this talk I gave an introduction to GIS (Geographic Information System) data and how to handle it in Python for those who haven't worked on that kind of data before.
I take them through some of the things they should be aware of, so if and when they deal with that data themselves, they know how to diagnose problems and search for what they need to solve the issues they might face.
