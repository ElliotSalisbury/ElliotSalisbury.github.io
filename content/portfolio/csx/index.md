Allometry is the study of how organisms change in relation to their body size.
In order to measure the health and growth of a forest, we used drones to fly over and capture imagery of the canopy. Photogrammetry and computer vision was then used to measure the height and canopy area of each individual tree.
From these measures an estimate of the tree's volume, and therefore the carbon mass, can be estimated.

That carbon mass was then used in a carbon sequestration measure, so that forestry landowners could sell carbon credits.
