I'm Elliot Salisbury, a Full Stack Data Scientist.

I am a data scientist with 10 years of broad industry and academic experience. As a consultant for the last 7 years I
have worked on a wide variety of projects advising senior decision-makers, and coaching staff, developing projects
that have large impacts on businesses, society, and the climate. In many of these projects, my role involves guiding
projects from their initial concept, through research & development, and deployment into production, and then
handing them over to the software engineering team for ongoing maintenance.
